# Nexra SEO Command Center

Professional, agency-grade AI SEO platform. This file defines the operating rules for the
project. Read it before writing any code.

**Current stage: Stage 5 (publication) of the content workflow. Milestones A, B, C1, C2, C3 and C5
are complete; C4 is implemented and deployed, with new-parser live verification pending; C6
Checkpoint 1 (database) and D3 are implemented and verified locally only — not pushed, not applied
to production; C6 Checkpoint 2 has not started (see §0).**

## 0. Current Checkpoint

GitHub `master`: `7fb652a23266ab312dfa1a65baecfe73c85988f0` (merge of `claude/c6-scope-docs`,
which defined C6; the C5 merge, PR #2, is `304ac1461860119f7a4fd47f94369de0a0894d9a`).

Local feature branch `claude/c6-article-proposal-db` (not pushed, not merged): C6 Checkpoint 1,
the PostgreSQL test harness and D3 — see *C6 local checkpoints* below.

**Completed content-workflow stages:**

- Stage 1: durable Writer draft persistence
- Stage 2: immutable operator version history
- Stage 3: exact-version fact-check
- Stage 4: exact-version approval gate
- Stage 5A: publication proposal + exact-version preview
- Stage 5B: website artifact dry-run
- Stage 5 / Complete Article Assembly — Milestone C1: Pure Article Contract (live verified)
- Stage 5 / Complete Article Assembly — Milestone C2: Article Persistence (live verified)
- Stage 5 / Complete Article Assembly — Milestone C3: Writer Section Choice (live verified)
- Stage 5 / Complete Article Assembly — Milestone C4: Article Check Units, Option A
  (implementation complete; deployment and existing-result browser verification complete;
  new-parser live verification pending)
- Stage 5 / Complete Article Assembly — Milestone C5: Article Approval Gate (complete, merged,
  deployed, production verified)

**C2 notes:** production migration applied (Supabase `20260923043554_create_articles`);
production deployment verified; live Version 1 creation and Version 2 immutable save verified
(article `c89182f9-4954-4834-8446-a831fc3c42d0`, drafting, version 2); stored hashes verified;
source provenance verified. No approval, fact-check, proposal or publication is part of C2.

**C3 notes:** the Writer's `section-draft` task requires an operator-chosen, zero-based
`sectionIndex`; there is no fallback to the first section, and a run queued without one is
refused at execution. No migration. Live verification: the explicit section chooser was
verified in production; the non-first section index 2 ("Where a person still belongs") was
selected; the Writer drafted exactly that section, with no fallback to section 0; grounding rules
stayed active and unsupported details were marked NEEDS EVIDENCE; the selected section saved
successfully as draft Version 1. No fact-check, approval or publication side effect occurred.

**C4 notes:** an article version is fact-checked in bounded units, never as one prompt: blocks
(metadata, lead-introduction, each H2 section, FAQs, CTA) cut into parts of at most 10 numbered
statements and 6,000 bytes, at most 150 units per version, keys `<block>:<part>`; heading context
is never checked twice; a unit passes only when every statement S1 … Sn is placed exactly once and
nothing is partial, unsupported or unverifiable. Results bind to one exact article version; the
article moves from `drafting` to `checked` only when its current version's unit set is complete
and all passed — never to `approved`. Verified locally: full test suite 1,354 passed; focused C4
tests 74 passed; typecheck, lint and production build passed; migration
`20260923180000_create_article_check_units.sql` validated with 60 assertions on an isolated
PostgreSQL 16.

**C4 release:** the production migration `20260923180000` was applied previously (history
recorded and verified). The counting fix (`892ffa0`, merged as `c23ed0b`) counts only numbered
statements S1 … Sn, each exactly once; keeps `Observation:` lines under EDITORIAL apart as
non-statement notes that never count toward coverage or evidence; and records an answer with a
missing, repeated, malformed or unexplained line as `failed` / `coverage-incomplete`, which a new
run may re-check. `passed` and `needs-review` stay final for their article version; stored
results are never rewritten. No migration. Production deployment
`dpl_FA7qMS5BbhWP4ByKzS7R6HAV8H2Z` is READY at `c23ed0b`.

**C4 production browser verification (operator):** article
`c89182f9-4954-4834-8446-a831fc3c42d0`, Version 2, displayed its four check units. Metadata
Unit 0 (`metadata:1`) was checked by a real Research & Evidence run
(`e322fc1d-01b4-478e-9b4e-7726dc5b8644`) and recorded as **needs-review**; that saved result
remained unchanged after the deployment, and the updated UI shows its original coverage
discrepancy honestly: 9 of 8 numbered statements classified, coverage incomplete, 1 unnumbered
line. The remaining three units are unchecked. The article remains `drafting` — not checked, not
approved, not published. **Pending:** the corrected counting behaviour is covered by automated
tests (focused C4 87 passed; full suite 1,367 passed), but a NEW result produced with the
corrected parser has not been live-tested.

**C5 notes:** an operator approves one exact, immutable article version, and only when every C4
check unit of that exact version passed, the article is `checked`, the topic decision is
`update-existing` or `different-angle`, and no `[NEEDS EVIDENCE` placeholder remains; there is no
override. `nexra_article_approvals` (append-only history) binds the article, version number,
version row id, content SHA-256, unit count and ordered unit-set digest, operator and time; the
parent's `approved_version` / `approved_by` / `approved_at` stay the current-approval pointer, and
`nexra_articles_approved_is_current` requires `approved` to name the current version. The one
write is `nexra_article_approve_version` (`security definer`, under the parent's row lock). A later
version inherits nothing. Approval is not publication. Feature commit `57284d6`, merged as
`304ac14` (PR #2); production migration `20260924120000` applied and recorded in migration history;
production deployment `dpl_6HUTVPgTSZN2VWkoDGYW39RDnYEo` READY; production verified by the
operator: article `c89182f9-4954-4834-8446-a831fc3c42d0`, Version 2, shows **Not eligible** with no
Approve button (1 unit needs review, 3 unchecked, not Checked) and approval history 0. No article
has been approved.

**Current work:** Milestone C6 — Article Publication Proposal (record-only). Its database
checkpoint and D3 are implemented and verified locally; C6 is NOT complete and NOT production
verified. Each further step starts only with explicit user approval. Work beyond C6 is undecided.

C6 records an operator's intention to publish one exact approved article version. It records
proposal state only.

C6 adds:

- one record-only proposal for one exact approved current article version;
- exact binding to article id, version, version row id, content hash and the C5 approval;
- a registered destination;
- a slug;
- preview/document hash metadata only;
- an explicit operator-triggered "Record proposal";
- withdraw support.

C6 reuses:

- the C5 approval gate and approval history;
- the C1 canonical article content and content hash;
- the existing destination registry;
- the existing preview/completeness logic where appropriate.

C6 does NOT include: TSX publishing; GitHub writes; Vercel writes; `nexra-ai` writes; pull
request creation; merge; deployment; live publishing; C7. It never approves or publishes anything
automatically. Real rendering and publishing remain a later, separately approved milestone.

**C6 local checkpoints** (branch `claude/c6-article-proposal-db`, on `master` `7fb652a`; local only):

- `caae5d6` — **C6 Checkpoint 1: database gate, implemented and verified locally.** Migration
  `20260925120000_create_article_publication_proposals.sql`: `nexra_article_publication_proposals`
  bound to one exact approved version (version number and row id, content SHA-256, the exact C5
  approval row with its approver and time), a registered destination, the content's own slug (D1)
  and a preview hash; `proposed` or `withdrawn` only; insert, update, delete and truncate guards;
  one active proposal per article and per destination slug; `nexra_article_publication_propose`
  and `nexra_article_publication_withdraw` (`security definer`, under the article's row lock);
  service_role gets SELECT and EXECUTE on the two functions only. The pinned destination registry
  and live slugs (D2) are restated in SQL, with a repository drift test against `destinations.ts`
  and the pinned website template. It adds a foreign key to `nexra_article_approvals`, so a plain
  TRUNCATE of approvals is now refused by PostgreSQL (0A000) before the C5 guard.
- `16e7717` — **PostgreSQL test harness, repository-tracked** under `supabase/tests/`, with one
  runner, `bash supabase/tests/run.sh`, that builds and deletes a disposable local cluster (Unix
  socket only, TCP disabled, libpq environment cleared) and never connects to a hosted database.
  Needs bash and PostgreSQL 16 server binaries (Linux or WSL). Covers C2, C4, C5 (updated for the
  C6 foreign key and `security definer` inventory) and C6, with two-session races.
- `ac95fc2` — **D3 Option A, implemented and verified locally.** Migration
  `20260926120000_publication_proposals_cross_table_slug_lock.sql`: one BEFORE INSERT trigger on
  the draft proposal table and one on the article proposal table, sharing one function. For a row
  inserted as `proposed` it refuses a transaction that is not READ COMMITTED (0A000), takes a
  transaction advisory lock on the destination and slug, and raises unique_violation when the
  other table holds an active proposal; both propose functions answer `slug-taken`. At most one
  active proposal per (destination, slug) across both tables. New draft-side behaviour: a draft
  proposal is refused `slug-taken` while an active article proposal holds its destination and
  slug. No function body, grant, RLS setting or application code changed. The migration refuses
  to apply over an existing cross-table duplicate. Adds a draft-proposal regression suite.
- **Local verification at `ac95fc2`:** every harness suite passed (40 of 40 checks: C2 54, C4 60,
  C5 69, drafts 40, C6 146, C6-D3 35 assertions; C2, draft, C6 and D3 races; a 12-session stress
  run with no deadlock; D3 preflight; C6 rollback); `npm test` 1,420 passed; typecheck, lint and
  production build passed.

**C6 status and pending items:**

- The C6 migration `20260925120000` and the D3 migration `20260926120000` have **not** been
  applied to production. Applying them is a separate §6 approval. Before it, read-only production
  checks: `show default_transaction_isolation;` must be `read committed`, and no destination/slug
  may be active in both proposal tables.
- The branch `claude/c6-article-proposal-db` has **not** been pushed, and there is no pull request
  or merge.
- **C6 Checkpoint 2** (application service, API, Server Actions, UI and preview) has **not**
  started.
- No article has been approved, proposed or published by C6.
- The existing draft UI message for `slug-taken` ("Another draft's active proposal already uses
  this slug…") is inaccurate once an article proposal can hold the slug; its wording needs a
  later, separately approved correction.

**Current safety boundaries:**

- No automatic publishing.
- No automatic approval.
- No write path to the `abdulrehmanvigo2-hash/nexra-ai` GitHub repository exists.
- The current production draft, Version 2, remains **Needs review**.
- There is no active publication proposal for Version 2.
- The content workflow has no Create PR, Merge, Deploy or Publish control, and C6 adds none: C6
  records proposal state only.
- Article `c89182f9-4954-4834-8446-a831fc3c42d0` is `drafting`: one check unit needs review,
  three are unchecked, and it is neither checked, approved nor published. Its Version 2 can never
  be approved (a needs-review result is final for its version), so it cannot receive a C6 proposal.
- Vercel deploys every push to `master` to production automatically.
- Any external write requires explicit user approval (§6).

Update this section at every Git checkpoint that changes the stage, the next planned
milestone, or a safety boundary.

---

## 1. Development Workflow

Every unit of work follows this loop, without skipping steps:

```
Plan → Build One Bounded Feature → Test → Fix → Git Commit → Next Feature
```

- **Plan** — state what will be built, which files are touched, and what is explicitly out of scope.
- **Build one bounded feature** — one feature per cycle. No opportunistic side-work.
- **Test** — run the app locally, exercise the feature, check the console for errors.
- **Fix** — resolve everything found in testing before moving on.
- **Git commit** — one checkpoint per completed feature (see §10).
- **Next feature** — only after the previous cycle is closed.

## 2. Current Architecture

A Next.js 16 application (read `AGENTS.md` before writing Next.js code) with a Supabase
Postgres production backend. `docs/BACKEND.md` is the detailed reference; `supabase/README.md`
lists the migrations in order.

- **Operator authentication** — Supabase Auth. One level: operator or nobody; operators are
  confirmed users listed in `NEXRA_OPERATOR_EMAILS`. `src/proxy.ts` gates every page, and every
  write and data endpoint re-checks the operator server-side.
- **Database** — Row level security with no policies on every table; the server alone uses
  `service_role`. Lifecycle and immutability rules are enforced in Postgres (triggers,
  `security definer` functions).
- **Live agent execution** — the agent runtime (`src/lib/agent-runs`, `/api/agent-runs/*`,
  `/api/worker/*`) queues and runs tasks for the twelve registry agents, with attempts, leases,
  retries and a scheduled worker. The executor is `mock` by default or `ai` (Anthropic).
- **Crawl grounding** — the crawl foundation (`src/lib/crawl`, `/api/crawls/*`) records own-site
  and competitor crawls; crawl-grounded agent tasks read those records.
- **Google Search Console grounding** — a read-only service account (`src/lib/search-console`);
  the Search Console panel and two agent tasks read the project's own report.
- **Content workflow** (`src/lib/content`, `/api/content-drafts`, `/api/content-publications`):
  - immutable content drafts and operator versions;
  - version-bound fact-check of one exact version;
  - exact-version approval;
  - publication proposals for one exact approved version, which publish nothing;
  - website artifact dry-run, rendered offline, which writes nothing anywhere.

Everything else on screen (rankings, technical, competitor, backlink, AI-visibility and
reporting figures) is still modelled fixture data from `src/lib/mock`. It must stay labelled as
such (`src/config/build-status.ts`). Never present fixture data as live, or live data as a
fixture.

## 3. Build Principles

- Extend the existing modules and patterns; do not introduce a parallel implementation.
- Server-side first: validation, authorisation and state rules live on the server and, where
  they protect data, in the database.
- Grounded, not invented: agents and renderers use only records the product holds. A missing
  value is reported as missing, never filled in.
- Every screen keeps real states (loading, empty, error, not connected) and honest labels.
- Every change is additive and reversible unless the user approves otherwise. Existing
  migrations are never edited; a schema change is a new migration.

## 4. Out of Scope Until Explicitly Requested

Do **NOT** build any of the following until the user explicitly asks:

- Publishing content to any website, or any write to the `nexra-ai` repository (branch,
  commit, pull request, merge, deployment)
- Create PR / Merge / Deploy / Publish controls in the product
- Billing / payments / subscriptions
- New external integrations (GA4, Ahrefs, Semrush, CMS, webhooks, and similar)
- Replacing a fixture-backed screen with live data, beyond the feature requested

## 5. Dependency Rules

Before adding **any** dependency, package, MCP server, CLI, SDK, or tool:

1. **Inspect the current project first** — read `package.json` and the existing code.
2. **Identify what is actually required** for the current bounded feature.
3. **Avoid unnecessary installations** — no "nice to have" packages.
4. **Prefer existing dependencies** — solve it with what is already installed.
5. **Install only safe, project-level dependencies** needed for the current task.

No global installs. Nothing added "for later".

## 6. Approval Required

Ask the user and wait for explicit approval before any of these:

- Authentication
- API keys
- Paid services
- Paid APIs
- OAuth
- Database setup
- Production credentials
- External webhooks
- System-level changes
- Global CLI installs
- DNS / domain changes
- Deployment configuration
- Applying a migration to the production database, or changing production data
- Switching the agent executor, AI provider or model (`NEXRA_AGENT_EXECUTOR`,
  `NEXRA_AI_PROVIDER`, `NEXRA_AI_MODEL`)
- Any write to an external repository or service, including `nexra-ai` (branch, commit,
  pull request, merge, deployment, publication)

## 7. Security Rules

- **Never expose secrets in frontend code.**
- **Never hardcode** API keys, tokens, passwords, webhook secrets, or private credentials.
- **Use environment variables** for all configuration and secrets.
- **Never commit `.env` secrets to Git.** `.env*` files stay in `.gitignore`; only
  `.env.example`, with empty placeholder values, is committed.
- Any value carrying a client-exposure prefix (for example `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) is public by
  definition — never put a secret behind one.
- Verify no secrets are staged before every commit.

## 8. File Safety Rules

- **Do not modify unrelated files.** Touch only what the current feature requires.
- **Do not delete working files or make destructive changes without approval.**
- **Preserve working UI and existing functionality.** No refactors bundled into feature work.
- No mass reformatting, no renaming sweeps, no restructuring outside the requested scope.

## 9. Testing Discipline

- **Test every completed feature before continuing.**
- Run the app locally and exercise the feature by hand.
- Check every route the change touches.
- Check the browser console and the terminal for errors and warnings.
- Verify responsive behaviour at mobile, tablet, and desktop widths.
- Verify no regressions in previously working screens.
- Run the available checks before committing: `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm run db:seed:check` when the seed or projects change.
- Add unit tests beside the code for every new server module, contract or renderer.

## 10. Git as a Checkpoint System

After each completed bounded feature:

1. **Review changed files** — `git status`, `git diff`.
2. **Run available checks** — type check, lint, build.
3. **Verify no secrets are included** in the staged diff.
4. **Make a clear commit** describing the completed feature.

One feature per commit. Commit messages state what was built, in plain language.

## 11. Development Order

```
Local Project → Localhost Testing → Git Checkpoint → GitHub → Vercel
```

**Production hardening must happen before public deployment.** No deployment step is taken
until the user asks for it and the hardening pass is complete.

## 12. Product Standards

Primary UI language: **English**.

The product should feel:

- Premium
- Modern
- Clean
- Professional
- Technical
- Agency-grade
- SaaS-ready
- Data-focused

**Avoid:**

- Cheap template appearance
- Excessive gradients
- Random animations
- Clutter
- Oversized cards
- Cartoon visuals
- Dead buttons
- Broken links
- Inconsistent spacing

Design discipline: a consistent spacing scale, a restrained palette, dense but legible data
display, real states (loading, empty, error), and no control that does nothing.

## 13. Architecture

### Main Navigation

The sidebar supports these destinations, in this order:

1. Command Center
2. Projects
3. AI Agents
4. Keyword Intelligence
5. Content Studio
6. Technical SEO
7. Competitor Intelligence
8. AI Visibility
9. Backlinks & Authority
10. Analytics
11. Reports
12. Settings

Every navigation item resolves to a real route. No dead links.

### The 12 AI Agents

| # | Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | SEO Director / Orchestrator | Owns strategy, sequences the other agents, arbitrates priorities |
| 2 | Project Manager | Intake, scope, scheduling, task state, delivery tracking |
| 3 | Market & Competitor Intelligence | Market landscape, SERP competitors, positioning, share of voice |
| 4 | Keyword & Search Intent | Keyword discovery, clustering, intent classification, prioritisation |
| 5 | Content Strategist | Content plans, briefs, topical maps, internal-linking strategy |
| 6 | Research & Evidence | Sources, facts, citations, evidence behind every claim in content |
| 7 | Writer | Drafts content against briefs, tone, and structure |
| 8 | On-Page SEO | Titles, meta, headings, entities, internal links, on-page optimisation |
| 9 | Technical SEO | Crawlability, indexation, Core Web Vitals, schema, site health |
| 10 | AI Visibility / AEO / GEO | Visibility in AI answers and generative engines, answer-readiness |
| 11 | Authority & Backlink | Link opportunities, digital PR, authority signals |
| 12 | Analytics & Learning | Performance measurement, attribution, learnings fed back into strategy |

Agent profiles, statuses and activity feeds come from the fixture registry
(`src/lib/mock/agents`). Agent **runs** are real: the runtime executes read-only review tasks,
grounded in stored projects, crawls, Search Console or earlier runs, plus the Writer's
`section-draft` task. The full task-type list is in `docs/BACKEND.md` (*Agent runtime*).

### Long-Term Agent Workflow

```
Project Added
  → Project Manager
  → SEO Director
  → Competitor Intelligence
  → Keyword Intelligence
  → Content Strategy
  → Research
  → Writing
  → On-Page SEO
  → Technical SEO
  → AI Visibility
  → Authority Building
  → Analytics & Learning
  → Feedback to SEO Director
```

The loop closes: Analytics & Learning feeds back into the SEO Director, which re-prioritises
the next cycle. The UI should represent this as a continuous cycle, not a one-way pipeline.

## 14. Build Sequence

The frontend foundation (app shell, navigation, the twelve screens, UI primitives, fixture
data layer) and the backend foundation (Supabase, operator sign-in, agent runtime, crawl
foundation, Search Console) are complete. Current work follows the content workflow:

| Stage | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 | Durable Writer draft persistence | Complete |
| Stage 2 | Immutable operator version history | Complete |
| Stage 3 | Exact-version fact-check | Complete |
| Stage 4 | Exact-version approval gate | Complete |
| Stage 5A | Publication proposal + exact-version preview | Complete |
| Stage 5B | Website artifact dry-run | Complete |
| Stage 5 / C1 | Complete Article Assembly: Pure Article Contract | Complete, live verified |
| Stage 5 / C2 | Complete Article Assembly: Article Persistence | Complete, live verified |
| Stage 5 / C3 | Complete Article Assembly: Writer Section Choice | Complete, live verified |
| Stage 5 / C4 | Complete Article Assembly: Article Check Units | Implementation complete; deployment and existing-result browser verification complete; new-parser live verification pending |
| Stage 5 / C5 | Complete Article Assembly: Article Approval Gate | Complete, merged, deployed, production verified |
| Stage 5 / C6 | Complete Article Assembly: Article Publication Proposal (record-only) | Checkpoint 1 (database) and D3 implemented and verified locally; not pushed; not applied to production; Checkpoint 2 not started |

Stages are executed in order. Each stage is broken into bounded features, and each bounded
feature gets its own workflow cycle (§1) and Git checkpoint (§10). Current: C6 — Article
Publication Proposal (record-only), with Checkpoint 1 and D3 local only and Checkpoint 2 not
started. Work beyond C6 is undecided and is not planned here.

## 15. Definition of Done

A feature is done only when **all** of the following are true:

- [ ] Requested scope complete
- [ ] UI polished
- [ ] Interactions working
- [ ] No unrelated regressions
- [ ] Local tests passed
- [ ] Changed files reviewed
- [ ] Ready for Git checkpoint

Anything short of this is not done, and the next feature does not start.

## 16. Claude Code Behavior

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md` first.**
2. **Inspect the project** before writing code — existing files, dependencies, patterns.
3. **Identify the relevant files** for the task.
4. **Build only the requested bounded feature.**
5. **Avoid unrelated changes.**
6. **Test the result.**
7. **Report exactly what changed** — file by file.
8. **Report the tests performed** and their outcome.
9. **Report remaining issues** honestly, including anything left incomplete.
10. **Stop before starting the next major feature** unless explicitly asked to continue.

When a request is ambiguous, ask before building. When a rule in this file conflicts with a
request, say so and wait for the user's decision.
