# Nexra Backend

What the backend is, how it is secured, and what a deployment needs. Written at
the end of Backend Phase 6 (Part 3). It describes only what is built and was
verified; limitations are listed at the end.

## Architecture

A Next.js 16 application. The pages are the product surface; the backend is its
server-side modules and route handlers, with Postgres (Supabase) as the only
store.

```
Browser ── proxy (src/proxy.ts) ── pages (Server Components) ── repositories / services ── Supabase Postgres
                                 └─ /api/* route handlers ──┘                           └─ Google Search Console API
Vercel Cron ── /api/worker/* ── agent runtime worker ── executor (mock | AI provider)
```

| Area | Module | Store |
|---|---|---|
| Projects | `src/lib/projects` | `public.projects` |
| Sign-in | `src/lib/auth`, `src/proxy.ts` | Supabase Auth |
| Search Console | `src/lib/search-console`, `/api/search-console/report` | Google API (read-only) |
| Agent runtime | `src/lib/agent-runs`, `/api/agent-runs/*`, `/api/worker/*` | `public.agent_runs`, `public.agent_run_attempts` |
| Shared rate limits | `src/lib/security/shared-rate-limit.ts` | `public.rate_limit_windows` |
| Logs | `src/lib/observability/log.ts` | stdout (JSON lines) |

Everything else on screen — rankings, content, technical, competitor, backlink,
AI-visibility, and reporting figures — is still modelled fixture data, labelled
as such. Nothing measures it yet.

## Supabase

Postgres holds projects, agent runs, attempts, and rate-limit windows. Every
table has row level security with no policies: no browser-side client can read
or write it. The server uses the secret (`service_role`) key, which never leaves
the server. The rules that matter are enforced in the database, for every
writer, the server included:

- the run lifecycle and its immutable request fields (trigger);
- one active identical request (partial unique index);
- attempts start, renew, finish, and are recovered only through
  `security definer` functions executable by `service_role` alone — the
  service role cannot write attempt rows directly;
- automatic retries are counted only by the retry function.

Migrations, in order, are listed in [`supabase/README.md`](../supabase/README.md#applying-migrations).
They are applied by pasting each file into the SQL Editor, followed by
`NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`.

## Auth model

One level: operator or nobody. An operator is a Supabase Auth user with a
confirmed email that is listed in `NEXRA_OPERATOR_EMAILS`. The proxy gates every
page with the verified session token; every write and every data endpoint
re-checks the user with the Auth server (`getOperator`). Session cookies are
`httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`; writes also require a same-origin request. Private
responses are `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.

The worker routes are the one exception to session auth — see below.

## Search Console

A service account reads Search Console for projects mapped in
`SEARCH_CONSOLE_PROPERTIES`. Read-only: no property, user, sitemap, or removal
calls exist. Reports are fetched server-side, cached briefly, and shown beside —
never mixed into — modelled figures, with explicit not-connected, no-data,
partial, and stale states. Verified for `nexra-agency`
(`sc-domain:nexraagency.com`).

## Agent runtime

An operator asks one of the twelve registry agents to run a task on a stored
project. Two task types exist, both read-only: `project-review` (any agent) and
`keyword-research` (Keyword & Search Intent). Input is parsed strictly per task
type, bounded, and screened for credentials; unknown fields are refused.

Lifecycle, enforced in Postgres:

```
queued → running → completed
             ├──→ failed → queued   (manual or automatic retry, while attempts remain; 3 by default)
             └──→ cancelled
queued → cancelled
```

### Attempt history

`agent_run_attempts` keeps one row per attempt: number, executor, worker label,
start, last heartbeat, finish, outcome, fixed error code/message, screened
result metadata. `agent_runs` is the current state. The API returns attempts
without the lease token or worker label.

### Leases, heartbeats, recovery

A claim starts an attempt and returns a lease token (60 s, database clock). The
worker renews it every 15 s. A result is accepted only from the current
attempt's live lease; a cancelled, recovered, or lapsed lease is refused and the
worker stops without writing. An attempt whose lease expired — crash, timeout,
killed request — is failed with `lease-expired` by recovery. Recovery is
idempotent and never completes a run.

### Worker and scheduler

`src/lib/agent-runs/worker.ts` is the execution boundary: claim, heartbeat,
execute with timeout, record, recover, schedule retries, and run a bounded batch.
It has no HTTP or auth of its own. Three callers use it:

| Caller | Route | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Operator executes a run | `POST /api/agent-runs/<id>` `{action:"execute"}` | operator session, same-origin |
| Operator manual trigger | `POST /api/agent-runs/worker` `{action:"recover-stale"\|"run-next"}` | operator session, same-origin |
| Scheduler | `GET\|POST /api/worker/recover`, `GET\|POST /api/worker/process` | `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` only |
| Diagnostics | `GET /api/worker/status` | worker credential or operator session |

Execution happens inside the invoking request; nothing runs detached after a
response. `vercel.json` schedules:

| Job | Schedule | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/worker/recover` | every 15 min | fails up to 25 expired attempts |
| `/api/worker/process` | every 10 min | re-queues retryable failures, then runs up to 5 due runs within a 240 s budget (`maxDuration` 300 s) |

Both are safe to call repeatedly and concurrently: claims use row locks
(`for update skip locked` for the queue), so overlapping invocations never run
the same attempt. With no work, both answer 200 with empty lists.

Why this frequency: runs are operator-initiated and read-only, so minutes of
latency are acceptable; backoffs start at 2 minutes; and each invocation is
capped. Vercel's cron frequency and function duration limits depend on the plan
— confirm the plan allows a 10-minute cron and a 300 s function before deploying,
or lengthen the schedule.

### Retry policy

Retried automatically, while attempts remain, with backoff of 2, 4, 8 … minutes
(max 30), by the queue job:

| Retryable | Terminal (never retried automatically) |
|---|---|
| `timeout` | `rejected-output` — output too large or credential-like |
| `execution-failed` | `project-missing` |
| `lease-expired` | `provider-rejected` — provider refused, truncated, or invalid request |
| `provider-unavailable` — network, 429, 5xx, overload | `provider-not-configured` |
| | `policy-blocked` |

Invalid requests (unknown project, agent, or task; malformed or credential-like
input) are refused before a run exists. Cancelled runs are never retried. The
list lives in both `agent_run_schedule_retries` (SQL) and
`src/lib/agent-runs/retry-policy.ts`; change them together.

### Executor and provider boundary

`NEXRA_AGENT_EXECUTOR` selects the executor.

- `mock` (default): simulated output, labelled `simulated: true`.
- `ai`: `src/lib/agent-runs/ai-executor.ts` over a `ModelProvider`
  (`providers/contract.ts`). One provider exists: Anthropic
  (`providers/anthropic.ts`, official SDK, default model `claude-opus-5`, SDK
  retries off, server-side refusal fallback on). The prompt is built only from
  the agent registry, the task type's fixed instructions, the project's name and
  domain, and the validated input passed as labelled data. The model has no
  tools or live data and is told so. The answer is screened like any executor
  output; stored metadata is provider, model, token counts, `grounded: false`.
  Raw provider responses are not stored. Provider failures map to
  `provider-unavailable` or `provider-rejected`; provider text is dropped.

No AI provider key is configured in this environment. The provider was verified
against simulated HTTP responses (success, refusal, truncation, 400/401/404,
429/500/529, network failure), not against the live API.

### Action policy

Every task type declares `read-only`, `draft`, `approval-required`, or
`executable` (`src/lib/agent-runs/action-policy.ts`). Only `read-only` and
`draft` run; an `approval-required` task is refused at creation and, if its
policy is tightened later, failed with `policy-blocked` before execution. Both
existing tasks are `read-only`. Never automated: publishing, deleting pages,
creating backlinks, outreach, destructive Search Console actions, DNS or domain
changes.

### Run history UI

Agents → Run History: project and agent filters, status, task, created /
started / finished, attempts (with automatic retries), screened summary labelled
simulated or model-generated, fixed error message, next retry time, and
expandable attempts.

## Security model

- Secrets are server-only environment variables; none has a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` name,
  and configuration readers refuse one that does. Verified: no secret value,
  secret variable name, or provider SDK code in `.next/static`.
- Row level security on every table; `service_role` only; lifecycle and lease
  rules enforced by triggers and definer functions.
- Operators: Auth-server check on every write and data read; same-origin writes;
  JSON bodies ≤ 16 KB.
- Worker: `CRON_SECRET` ≥ 32 characters, compared in constant time via SHA-256,
  never logged or stored; a bare 401 for every failure.
- Rate limits shared across instances (Postgres): run creation 30/10 min and run
  actions 60/10 min per operator; manual worker triggers 30/10 min per operator;
  scheduled jobs 60/hour per job. Refusals are 429 with `Retry-After`.
- Stored failures and API errors are fixed codes and messages; no exception or
  provider text.
- Logs are JSON lines with allowlisted fields (run, project, agent, task,
  attempt, executor, transition, duration, error code, job counts); values that
  look like credentials are redacted.

## Environment variables

All server-only. `.env.example` has placeholders.

| Variable | Required | Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PROJECTS_DATA_SOURCE` | production: `supabase` | no | data source; unset = fixtures, no runtime |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | with Supabase | no | project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | with Supabase | **yes** | server database access |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | yes | no | sign-in |
| `NEXRA_OPERATOR_EMAILS` | yes | no | operator allow-list |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` | for Search Console | no | service account |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` | for Search Console | **yes** | service account key |
| `SEARCH_CONSOLE_PROPERTIES` | for Search Console | no | project → property map |
| `CRON_SECRET` | production | **yes** | scheduled worker credential |
| `NEXRA_AGENT_EXECUTOR` | no | no | `mock` (default) or `ai` |
| `NEXRA_AI_PROVIDER` | with `ai` | no | `anthropic` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | with `ai` | **yes** | provider key |
| `NEXRA_AI_MODEL` | no | no | defaults to `claude-opus-5` |

## Deployment requirements

1. Apply all migrations in order and reload the API schema.
2. Set the environment variables above in the hosting project (production scope),
   including a fresh random `CRON_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
3. Create operator accounts in Supabase Auth; disable open sign-ups.
4. Confirm the hosting plan supports the cron schedule and 300 s functions.
5. Keep `NEXRA_AGENT_EXECUTOR` unset until a provider key and budget are agreed.
6. After deploying, call `GET /api/worker/status` with the worker credential and
   check that counts return and `expiredLeases` stays at 0.

Nothing has been deployed.

## Known limitations

- Execution runs inside a request or a cron invocation, not a long-lived
  worker: one invocation handles at most 5 runs, so sustained backlogs drain at
  the schedule's pace.
- Sign-in attempts and project creation are still rate limited in process
  memory, not in the shared table.
- Shared limits use fixed windows: up to twice a limit can pass across a window
  boundary.
- Run cancellation and manual retry take their timestamps from the application
  server's clock; claims, attempts, recovery, and retry scheduling use the
  database clock. Servers without synchronised clocks show slightly inconsistent
  times.
- The AI executor has no tools or live data; its output is advice, labelled as
  model-generated. It has not been exercised against the live provider.
- No approval workflow exists; `approval-required` tasks cannot run at all.
- Reporting figures outside Search Console remain fixtures.
- Run history lists the latest 25 runs per filter, without pagination.
